This showcase currently links me to all my forms of contact, Github, LinkedIn and email. 

#24_Hour_Projects
As I currently don't work, I have thought of an idea to start expanding on my portfolio. I will give myself a task to complete, set time for the task will always be 24-hours, if extra time is needed I will have both versions 24-hours and XX-hours to make you see the differences between the two.

This project tab will include : 
- Learning new Technologies
- Researching and understanding the topic at hand
- Full stack development
- Schematic of what the website is suppose to look like and achieve.

At the moment my portfolio is barebones, however I do plan on expanding it in a timely fashion until I can properly fill out everything.
