# Amir_Portfolio_Welcome
This is my responsive portfolio that I created from scratch using the technologies I know. At the moment my portfolio is barebones, however I do plan on expanding it in a timely fashion until I can properly make it to my liking and without overworking it. I'll be sure to release multiple versions of the webpage : Initial Completion, more indepth customizations, various device and resolution support, general optimizations and/or more attractive features. I also want this to be as if it were a fully functional website with proper callbacks, being able to navigate everywhere without running into any issues.

# Home

It says my name, Amir Amirvand and my profession of being a full stack web developer.

This showcase currently links me to all my forms of contact, Github, LinkedIn and email. 

# Projects

- 24_Hour_Projects
As I currently don't work, I have thought of an idea to start expanding on my portfolio. I will give myself a task to complete, set time for the task will always be 24-hours, if extra time is needed I will have both versions 24-hours and XX-hours to make you see the differences between the two.

This project tab will include : 
- Learning new Technologies
- Researching and understanding the topic at hand
- Full stack development
- Schematic of what the website is suppose to look like and achieve.

# Contact

- This is suppose to be a dropdown box with my contact information for you to better reachout to me. Wit hit also in a few other locations spread around the website.

# Resume

- This will always link you to a view version of my google docs resume. This makes sure that is always the most up to date version.
